# Xenoblade 3 modding tools for casuals
It all started when I saw that Shulk and Rex couldn't give their class to the main team.

It's ambitious, but the ultimate goal is to create software that can at least simplify modding development (I have some knowledge of Qt, it's time to use it).

I can't thank World Tree Research enough for his huge work (https://discord.gg/27Wz4QB).

There's a sheet who contains database of all models and maps in Xenoblade 3 : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wgzG4gIgd8iY6GyYw_ObsUTDjE0ZvE2CMNtX5WrWzs
